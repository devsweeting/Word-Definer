# The Word Definer

#### Week 2 Ruby Independent Project

#### By Devin Sweeting

## Description

This application contains a Word class. The homepage of the app should list all words. When a word is clicked, it should lead to a page with the word's definitions. Children should be able to add a word, and when viewing a word, be able to add one or more definitions. This application is deployed to Heroku so the kids can try it out!

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* Log in to GitHub_
* Clone GitHub URL in terminal_
* Open the html file in your Web Browser_
* Open file in Atom_
* Link to github:

_{Leave nothing to chance! You want it to be easy for potential users, employers and collaborators to run your app. Do I need to run a server? How should I set up my databases? Is there other code this app depends on?}_

## Known Bugs

* Delete function does not currently work, App is deployed to Heroku but it won't start the application. Highly reccommend starting from local server.
